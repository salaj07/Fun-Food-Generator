# Fun Food Generator 🍔🍕🍟

This is a fun beginner-level project made using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Click the **"Generate Food"** button to spawn random food images (like burger, pizza, fries, etc.) anywhere on the screen.  
Images are placed at random positions — and yes, overlapping is part of the fun! 😄

---

## 🔧 Features

- One new food image appears on each click
- Images can overlap for chaotic fun
- No flipping or rotation — always upright
- Stylish restaurant-themed background
- Clean button and responsive layout

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using `Math.random()` for randomness
- Working with the DOM: `createElement`, `appendChild`
- Handling click events with `addEventListener()`
- Basic styling and layout with Flexbox and background images
